# PyBer_Analysis


## Project Overview & Challenge
In this module challenge we analyzed all the rideshare data for company called PyBer.
    - Data sets containing ride and city data were used to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride & driver for each   of the respective city types. 
    
    - Data sets were also used to create new data frame to find the average fare per week and create from January thru April 2019 for each city types

    - Data frame was used to create a mutiple-line graph to visualize the total weely fares for each city types.

    - Metrics and visualization created was analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of PyBer


## Resources
    - Data Source: city_data.csv  and ride_data.csv
    - Software: Conda version 4.10.0 using Jupyter Notebook Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy libraries

## Summary & Results

### PyBer DataFrame Summary

PyBer data frame summary shows that Urban city type provides higher revenue than the other city type. This is because Urban having a higher population than Rural and Subruban. However the average fare compared to Rural and Suburban city types, Rural and Suburban have higher average fare per ride which means a chance of more revenue for every ride increase compared to Urban city type. The average fare per driver also shows that that Rural and Suburban rate is higher than Urban which means Urban city type make almost 2-3 times less per ride than the Rural and Suburban. 


### PyBer Multiple line chart

A multiple line chart was also created to hep visualize and perform analysis of weelkly Total Fares for from January thru April 2019 for each city type. Urban city type generates more revenue on all the weeks from January to the end of April.  We can also see that the peak rideshare is on the 3rd week of Febrauary for all city tpe.

## Summary

    - Due to Rural poverty, PyBer ride-sharing services would not be the first option for travels as the fares are pretty high. A lower or affordable fare for more riders to join in . 
    
    - We do not have the data to analyze the population of each city type but maybe they don't have enough drivers. Maybe adding more drivers for Rural and Suburban areas will increase ride-sharing. 

    - Incentives for both riders and drivers for both Rural and Suburban areas will attract more riders and drivers to join for increase revenue.
